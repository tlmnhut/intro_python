    # 1. Go to https://github.com/oprogramador/most-common-words-by-language/tree/master/src/resources
    # and download a few vocab files.

    # 2. Read a vocab file, count the number of characters in each word
    # Write the results in a new file with the format:
    #       word_1 length_of_word_1
    #       word_2 length_of_word_2
    #       ... ...
    # You should write a function to do that

    # 3. Use the function above to do the same thing for other vocab files
    # Then, you can just open the result files to see what word is longest for each language

    # 4. Modify the function above to return the average number of characters in a word for each language
    # Then you can see among the languages you chose, which language has more characters per word

    # 5. Use argparse to run the script from the terminal

    # 6. Extra: imagine you have 100 vocab lists in your folder, how can you read all of them without
    # manually input each file name?
