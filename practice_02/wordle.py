    # Solve the Wordle game at https://wordlegame.org/
    # It has multiple languages. You can adjust the word length as well.
    # You may try to play a few times, then you can see that:
    #   gray character: the word does not contain those
    #   yellow character: the word contains this character, but in another position
    #   green character: the word contains this character in the correct position

    # 1. Write a function to help you solve the wordle
    # You can freely design your function as you wish
    # Hint: the previous exercise can help you choose a set of words with a specific number of characters
    # You can read the results of the previous exercise to help you select words

    # I tried and it seems quite tricky for me.
    # Moreover, the vocab lists are limited, there are a lot of words
    # missing in the vocab lists. You may find other better vocab lists on the web.

    # 2. When you finish it, use argparse lib to run the script from the terminal.
